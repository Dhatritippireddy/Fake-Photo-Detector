# Fake-Photo-Detector
# Project Structure

## Project Definition

The project aims to create a simple tool for detecting signs of fakeness in images, with a focus on color anomalies, jagged edges, and strange patterns. The primary motivation is to identify potential manipulated or forged photos by analyzing visual attributes. The tool uses computer vision and image processing techniques to evaluate these attributes.

## How it Works (Principles)

### 1. Color Analysis
**Objective:** Identify unusual color distributions.
**Principle:** Calculates the average color and checks for extreme values. Unusual colors may indicate manipulation.

### 2. Edge Detection
**Objective:** Detect jagged edges, common in manipulated images.
**Principle:** Applies the Canny edge detector. A high mean of edges suggests jaggedness.

### 3. Pattern Recognition
**Objective:** Identify strange patterns in the image.
**Principle:** Checks for repeated patterns using a simple difference calculation. Unusual patterns may indicate manipulation.

### 4. Conclusion
**Objective:** Determine whether signs of fakeness were detected.
**Principle:** If any of the color, edge, or pattern rules trigger, the script concludes that the image might be fake. Otherwise, it is considered real.
